# Cheat codes
cheat codes are not case sensitive
- catnip
  - you are invincible (Pressing "respawn" overrides this)
- pigeon
  - you can jump infinitely (and gives your wings)
- rainbow rat
  - rats can spawn as any color (typically they only spawn in "normal" rat colors)
- rainbow jump
  - you change color every time you jump
- ghost rat
  - removes the fur layer of the rat (you still have an outline)
- lab rat
  - use the rat's test animations
- dev mode
  - unlocks all codes

NOTE: having both ghost rat and lab rat makes you invisible
